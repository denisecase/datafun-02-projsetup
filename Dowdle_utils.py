# 1. Project Start
'''44608-80/81 - Data Fundamentals - P1
This module provides a reusable byline for the author's services.
The goal of this module is to showcase the brand new company "Analytics America" 
skills in the world of consulting and analytics'''

# 2. Import Dependencies-Anything in the standard library is fair game.
import math
import statistics

# 3. Define Variables of Different Types-at least one variable of each of these types
# str, int, float, bool, list of strings, list of numbers.

Statistics of Our Client Satisfaction Scores:

# 7. Define Main Function-we can call to test our code and display all information.
